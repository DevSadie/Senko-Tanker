# Senko Tanker
A discord bot made in JS for moderation, weebines and memes and stuff.

## Folder structure
| Codebase                             | Description                                        |
|:-------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| [commands](/src/commands)            | Commands                                           |
| [config](/src/config)                | Bot configuration, Tokens                          |
| [controllers](/src/controllers)      | Controllers for the previous 2 folders             |
| [events](/src/events/)               | Event shenanigans                                  |
| [events/client](/src/events/client)  | Overly complicated logging machine                 |
| [events/server](/src/events/server/) | Even more shenanigans, but with commands this time |
| [functions](/src/functions/)         | Self contained pieces of code                      |

## Branches
* The `root` branch is the development branch, the alpha version of the bot is run here. The `alphaState` should be set to `true`
* The `stable` branch is the production branch, the stable version is hosted from this. The `alphaState` should be set to `true`

Do **NOT** push code to the stable branch, it is only intended to host a version of Senko-Tanker without documentation.

## Roadmap 
The roadmap is availble [here](https://github.com/Senko-Dev/Senko-Tanker/projects/1).

## How does this bot work?
This bot is made for those people who only just want a bot but have no devs on hand.

## Working with it
